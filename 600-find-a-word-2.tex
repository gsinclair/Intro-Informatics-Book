Idea: given a list of words and a length and width, create a find-a-word containing the
words (with at least some crossovers) and filled with random letters. The output should be
ready for printing (i.e. space between each letter and line).

Thoughts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To generate a unique correct answer, perhaps we might need to specify an algorithm
    for combining words \emph{and} provide a seed for the random number generator.
  \item Alternatively, this activity could appear as a ``special exercise'' where it's not
    the usual \IN/\OUT business but where correctness is judged by eye. In fact, there
    could be a chapter of such exercises that focus on broader programming skills and not
    informatics \emph{per se}.
\end{itemize}
