In the problems you've encountered so far, you would:
\begin{itemize}
  \item read a fixed number of items from \IN;
  \item perform some calculation on those items;
  \item write a result to \OUT.
\end{itemize}

items of input, and sooner or later you will need to write code that can handle input of
any size. Well, that time is now.
