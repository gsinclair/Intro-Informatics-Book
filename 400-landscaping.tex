\Question\ TODO. In the meantime, see worksheet.

\Input

\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$, the total number of workers;
    \item $N$ lines containing $m_i$, where $m_i$ is the profit that the $i$th worker would make if they mow;
    \item $N$ lines containing $p_i$, where $p_i$ is the profit that the $i$th worker would make if they prune.
\end{itemize}

You are guaranteed that all values are integers, and that $N > 0$.

\Output\ You will write a single integer to \OUT, which is the most profit you could
make if half the team mowed, while the other half pruned.

\Sample

\minipagestwo{%
\sample{0.4}{4\\5\\2\\6\\5\\3\\4\\3\\5}
       {0.4}{20} }{%
\sample{0.4}{8\\3\\2\\4\\4\\3\\6\\3\\1\\4\\2\\3\\2\\5\\3\\4\\2}
       {0.4}{31} }
