\Question\ You are at the bottom of a stairway leading up to the pearly gates of heaven.
There are $N$ steps in this staircase.

Since these are such special stairs, it would be a bit boring to just walk up them one
step at a time, wouldn't it? At each stair, you can choose to ascend either one step or
two. (You are unfortunately not tall enough to reach any further in one go.)

How many possible ways are there to go up $N$ steps to get to heaven?

\Input The input contains a single number, $N$, which is the number of stairs in the
stairway to heaven. You are guaranteed that $3 \le N \le 100$.

\Output\ You will write a single integer to \OUT: the number of ways to ascend the $N$
stairs.

\Sample
\minipagestwo{%
  \sample{0.2}{3}
         {0.2}{3}}{%
  \sample{0.2}{5}
         {0.2}{8}}

\Explanation In the first sample, you can go up three stairs the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 step, 1 step, 1 step
  \item 1 step, 2 steps
  \item 2 steps, 1 step
\end{itemize}
That's a total of three ways, hence the output \texttt{3}.

In the second sample, you can go up five stairs the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step
  \item 1 step, 2 steps, 2 steps
  \item 1 step, 2 steps, 1 step, 1 step
  \item 1 step, 1 step, 2 steps, 1 step
  \item 1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 2 steps
  \item 2 steps, 2 steps, 1 step
  \item 2 steps, 1 step, 2 steps
  \item 2 steps, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step
\end{itemize}
That's a total of eight ways, hence the output \texttt{8}.
