\questionheader{Hearts/Spades}

\Question\ You have a line of cards consisting of hearts on one side and spades
on the other. A heart card is represented by $H$, and a spades card is represented
by $S$. You are allowed to choose a card and flip that card and all of the cards 
to the right of it. For instance, if you chose the 4th card in the next line
you would flip the rightmost 6 cards:

H H S S H H S S S $\rightarrow$

H H S H S S H H H

How many cards should you flip to get the greatest number of spades in the line?

\Input

The input contains the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$, the total number of cards that you have;
    \item $N$ lines containing either $H$ or $S$ to indicate the card in that position.
\end{itemize}

You are guaranteed that $N$ is an integer such that $N > 0$.

\Output\ Write a single integer to \OUT, which represents the number of cards that
needs to be flipped to get the greatest number of spades in the line.

\Sample
\minipagestwo{%
  \sample{0.4}{14\\H\\S\\H\\H\\S\\S\\H\\S\\S\\H\\H\\S\\H\\H}
         {0.4}{9} }{%
  \sample{0.4}{5\\S\\S\\S\\H\\S}
         {0.4}{2} }

\Explanation For the first example, the following flips will result in the whole
line being spades:

\begin{inlinetable*}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        \toprule
        Flipped card & Line \\
        \midrule
        1st &  S H S S H H S H H S S H S S \\
        2nd &  S S H H S S H S S H H S H H \\
        3rd &  S S S S H H S H H S S H S S \\
        5th &  S S S S S S H S S H H S H H \\
        7th &  S S S S S S S H H S S H S S \\
        8th &  S S S S S S S S S H H S H H \\
        10th & S S S S S S S S S S S H S S \\
        12th & S S S S S S S S S S S S H H \\
        13th & S S S S S S S S S S S S S S \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{inlinetable*}

This required a total of 9 flips.

In the second example, the following flips are required:

\begin{inlinetable*}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        \toprule
        Flipped card & Line \\
        \midrule
        4th & S S S S H \\
        5th & S S S S S \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{inlinetable*}

This required a total of 2 flips.
