\Question\ An example of a \emph{Collatz chain} is as follows: \[
  7 \to 22 \to 11 \to 34 \to 17 \to 52 \to 26 \to 13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to
  8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.
\]

It should be reasonably apparent what the rule is. If a term $T_n$ is even, then $T_{n+1}$
is set to $\frac12 T_n$. If instead $T_n$ is odd, then $T_{n+1}$ is set to $3\cdot T_n +
1$. If and when 1 is reached, the chain terminates.

The Collatz chain beginning with 7 has length 17. Your job is as follows: given $N$, find
the length of the Collatz chain that starts with $N$.%
\footnote{It is conjectured but not proven that every Collatz chain terminates. It is
certainly true for all values ever tested with computers.}

\Input\ A single integer $N$, where $1 < N < 1000$.

\Output\ The length of the chain that starts with $N$. That is, the number of terms in the
sequence, including the first term ($N$) and the last term (1).

\Sample

\sample{0.2}{7}{0.2}{17}

\Explanation\ The sample matches the example given in the question.
