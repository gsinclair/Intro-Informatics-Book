\questionheader{\theproblemnumber\ Shopping (1)}

\Question\ You've just returned from the shops with the items you were asked to get. Your
dad asked ``How much was it?'', but you don't remember! You have to work it out quickly.
You bought exactly three \emph{kinds} of items, but different \emph{quantities} of each.

\Input

The input contains six lines: quantity 1, price 1, quantity 2, price 2, quantity 3, price
3. The quantities are integers in the range 1--10 and the prices are positive floats less
than 100 (representing \$100).

\Output\ The output is a single float containing the total price, and it must be rounded
to two decimal places.

\Sample

\sample{0.2}{6\\2.50\\8\\1.75\\3\\87.88}
       {0.2}{292.64}

\Explanation The output represents \$292.64, which is $6(\$2.50) + 8(\$1.75) + 3(\$87.88)$.

\Scratch\ You already know how to read an integer from \IN. See \futurereference{Appendix
...} for advice on reading and writing floats, especially outputing them rounded to two
decimal places.
