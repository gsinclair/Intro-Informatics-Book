\questionheader{Shopping (1)}

\Question\ You've just returned from the shops with the items you were asked to get. Your
dad asked ``How much was it?'', but you don't remember! You have to work it out quickly.
You bought exactly three \emph{kinds} of items, but different \emph{quantities} of each.

\Input The input contains six lines:
\begin{itemize}
  \item quantity 1
  \item price 1
  \item quantity 2
  \item price 2
  \item quantity 3
  \item price 3
\end{itemize}
The quantities are integers in the range 1--10 and the prices are positive floats less
than 100 (representing \$100).

\Output\ The output is a single float containing the total price, and it must be rounded
to two decimal places.

\Sample

\sample{0.2}{6\\2.50\\8\\1.75\\3\\87.88}
       {0.2}{292.64}

\Explanation The output represents \$292.64, which is $6(\$2.50) + 8(\$1.75) + 3(\$87.88)$.
