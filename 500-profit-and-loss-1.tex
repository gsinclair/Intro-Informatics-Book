\questionheader{Profit and loss (1)}

Idea: Given a starting company balance and a sequence of lines like \texttt{PROFIT 39000}
and \texttt{LOSS 15500}, find the final balance.

(Plot twist: maybe the first line could \emph{either} be \texttt{START nnnnn} or
\texttt{END nnnnn}, and the task is to calculate either the ending balance or the starting
balance, respectively.)
