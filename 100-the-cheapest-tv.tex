\questionheader{The cheapest TV}

\Question\ You walk the aisles of Bing Lee, looking for a new TV. You narrow it down to
five choices and decide to go with the cheapest. How much will you pay?

Your program will read five integers (representing prices in dollars) from \IN\ and write
the smallest number to \OUT.

\Sample

\sample{0.2}{499\\565\\325\\400\\717}
       {0.2}{325}

\Scratch\ If you have learned the lessons of the previous exercise well, you will complete
