\Question\ I have it in mind that I'd really like to be a millionaire. Unfortunately all I
have at the moment is $D$ dollars. But by earning $I$ per cent interest per annum,
compunded yearly, one day I will realise my dreams. The question is, how long will it
take?

\Input\ There are three lines in \IN.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The first line contains $D$, a positive integer number of dollars that I am
    depositing in the bank.
  \item The second line contains $I$, a positive float representing the interest rate that
    will be applied to my balance.
  \item The third line contains $T$, a positive integer representing my \emph{target}: the
    balance I want my bank account to exceed.
\end{itemize}

\Output\ A single positive integer $N$, representing the number of years I must wait until
my bank balance exceeds $T$.

\Sample

\minipagestwo{ \sample{0.4}{400\\3.5\\500}{0.4}{7} }
             { \sample{0.4}{15000\\2.21\\1000000}{0.4}{193} }

\Explanation The bank balance for the first sample follows this sequence (rounded to two
decimal places): \[
  400.00, \quad 414.00, \quad 428.49, \quad 443.49, \quad 459.01,
  475.07, \quad 491.70, \quad \mathbf{508.91}, \quad 526.72, \quad \dots
\]

It is after seven years that the balance exceeds the target of \$500, so the answer is
\texttt{7}.

In the second sample, it takes 193 years to grow the balance from \$15\,000 to over
\$1\,000\,000.
