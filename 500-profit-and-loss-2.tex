\questionheader{Profit and loss (2)}

Idea: Given a starting company balance and a sequence of lines like \texttt{PROFIT 39000}
and \texttt{LOSS 15500}, find the final balance. \emph{However}, if at any time the
balance goes negative, immediately output \texttt{Bankruptcy in month \#nnn} and terminate.
