\Question\ Given a scatterplot, there are a few ways to mathematically determine an
objective line of best fit. One way is to find the line that has the least sum-of-squares
when considering the distance from each point to the line.%
\footnote{See https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html for a nice
overview of this.}

In preparation for writing a program to find the line of best fit, then, you start by
finding the sum of squares of $N$ floating-point numbers.

\Input\ The first line contains the positive integer $N$, the number of data points for
you to consider. The next $N$ lines each contain a float, $D_i$.

\Output\ A single float, rounded to two decimal places, that represents the sum of squares
\[
  (D_1)^2 + (D_2)^2 + (D_3)^2 + \dots + (D_N)^2.
\]

\Sample

\sample{0.2}{5\\6.2\\-1.7\\4.29\\3.815\\-2}
       {0.2}{73.88}

\Scratch\ The important variable here, as with the previous problem, is \emph{total}.
Initialise it to zero and add the square of each input number.
